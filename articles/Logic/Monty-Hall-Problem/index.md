The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability problem made famous by the move "21" and base upon the game show, "Let's Make a Deal."

The problem is as follows:

"Suppose you are on a game show where you have 3 doors to choose from. Behind one door contains a brand new car; the others contain goats. You pick a door (let's say Door 1), and the host,who knows what is behind each door, opens Door 3 which contains a goat. He then asks you, "Would you like to change your choice?" Is it advantageous to change your decision?"

The problem is paradoxical because it seems that regardless of what you choose you will have a 1/3 to choose correctly since there were 3 doors and only one had a car. However, because of the insight of the host's knowledge,  we can deduce that he deliberately chose Door 3 and not Door 1 or 2. So, you can conclude that there is a 2/3 chance that the car is behind Door 2, and thus, it is to your advantage to make the change.
