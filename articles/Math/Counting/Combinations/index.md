A combination is a selection of objects from a collection in which the order does not matter. E.G. You have 4 cubes of differing colors (red, green, blue, and white respectively). There are specifically 6 ways of gathering cubes of differing colors. Red/Green, Red/Blue, Red/White, Green/Blue, Green/White, and Blue/White. 

Fundamentally this means that for a set of n-elements there are k number of cominations which equals:

which can be reduced to:

This process is usually referred to as "n choose k".
